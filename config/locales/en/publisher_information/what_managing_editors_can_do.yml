      body_govspeak: |
        Some Content Publisher user accounts have Managing Editor status.

        %{user_status}

        There are options which are only available to users with Managing Editor status.

        ## Withdraw content

        Managing Editors can withdraw documents on GOV.UK.

        Withdrawn documents stay online but show a banner that tells users they contain out of date information. The documents will not appear in internal search on GOV.UK.

        Managing Editors can also edit the banner message, or unwithdraw the document.

        ## History mode

        Managing Editors can change whether or not a document gets history mode.

        They can also edit documents that are already in history mode.
