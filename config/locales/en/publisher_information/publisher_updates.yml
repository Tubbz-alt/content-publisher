        ### History mode <span class="govuk-caption-m">12 December 2019</span>
        You can see if a document will go into history mode if there is a change of government. Managing Editors can change this setting.

        ### Adding to Document Collections <span class="govuk-caption-m">6 September 2019</span>
        You can now add content created in Content Publisher to document collections in Whitehall publisher.

        This can be done by editing the document collection in Whitehall and selecting the 'Add GOV.UK content created outside of Whitehall to a group' option on the 'Collection documents' screen.

        ### Access limiting <span class="govuk-caption-m">6 August 2019</span>
        You can now limit who is able to find and edit a document. You can only limit access before it is published. You can limit it to just publishers in the primary organisation, or to publishers in any tagged organisation.

        ### Backdating <span class="govuk-caption-m">27 June 2019</span>
        You can now backdate on content if it has previously been available on another web page.

        The public First Published date will tell users when the information was first available rather than when the new page was published. It is important that old information is not presented as new.

        ### Scheduling <span class="govuk-caption-m">26 June 2019</span>
        You can now schedule content to automatically go live at a later date and time.

        Or you can save a proposed date and time to inform colleagues when content should go live.

        ### Topic search added <span class="govuk-caption-m">24 Jun 2019</span>
        You can now search for topics. This will help you find the topics that best describe what your content is about.

        ### Attachments <span class="govuk-caption-m">29 May 2019</span>
        You can now upload file attachments and link to them in the body text of content using the Insert menu.

        Attachments can be displayed as icons or as simple links. Attachment titles can be edited and files can be replaced.

        ### Email links, content data, and guidance updates <span class="govuk-caption-m">17 May 2019</span>
        Added a link to [Content Data](https://content-data.publishing.service.gov.uk/content) from the edit screen so you can easily check the performance of published content.

        You can now make email links with the link button. Select an email address and the link button will add email markdown.

        Updated styling of markdown preview to help you see the difference between editing and preview more easily.

        Added [guidance to help users familiar with Whitehall publisher get started](/how-to-use-publisher).

        We have also updated the guidance on:

        - image captions and credits
        - image cropping
        - organisation tags
        - sending links for 2i review
        - address markdown

        ### Body text converted to markdown <span class="govuk-caption-m">17 April 2019</span>
        When you paste text into the body field Content Publisher will try to convert it to markdown. It will recognise headings, links, and lists. Other formatting will be removed and only plain text pasted.

        ### YouTube videos in content <span class="govuk-caption-m">8 April 2019</span>
        You can now embed YouTube videos in the body text of content using the Insert menu.

        ### Email notification when content is published <span class="govuk-caption-m">8 April 2019</span>
        You will now receive an email notification when a content edition you have worked on is published on GOV.UK.

        ### Document list defaults to your organisation <span class="govuk-caption-m">21 March 2019</span>
        The document search list will now only show content tagged to your organisation. You can clear filters to see all content tagged to any organisation.

        ### Images in body text <span class="govuk-caption-m">7 March 2019</span>
        You can now embed images in the body text of content using the Insert menu. Images can display a copyright credit if needed.

        ### Withdrawing content <span class="govuk-caption-m">12 February 2019</span>
        Managing Editors can now [withdraw](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/gov-uk-content-retention-and-withdrawal-archiving-policy) content without raising a support request.

        ### Internal notes added <span class="govuk-caption-m">30 January 2019</span>
        You can now add internal notes about a document on the Document History screen.

        ### Content Publisher is in beta <span class="govuk-caption-m">22 January 2019</span>
        Beta partners can now access Content Publisher to publish news stories and press releases. Most features are available, [some will be released later](/beta-capabilities).
