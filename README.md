# Content Publisher

A unified publishing application for content on GOV.UK

## Nomenclature

  * Content - Some text ([and related fields][content-schemas]) a user wants to publish
  * Revision - A version of a piece of content in a particular locale
  * Edition - A revision that is in the Publishing API
  * Document - All revisions of a piece of content in a particular locale


## Technical documentation

This is a Ruby on Rails application.

### Dependencies

- [postgresql][] - provides a backing database
- [yarn][] - package manager for JavaScripts
- [imagemagick][] - image manipulation library

### Running the application

The first time you run this application you'll want to set you
[permissions](#permissions).

Then, if you are running on the [GOV.UK development VM][dev-vm]:

```
cd /var/govuk/govuk-puppet/development-vm
bowl content-publisher
```

You should be able to access the app at: http://content-publisher.dev.gov.uk/

Otherwise, on your machine:

```
./startup.sh
```

### Running the test suite

```
yarn install
bundle exec rake
```

###Â Permissions

Functionality of this application is enabled with permissions. There is a
`pre_release_features` permission, for using functionality not yet available to
users, and there is a `debug` permission, to access debug and documentation in
app.

To enable these permissions in a development environment run:

```
bundle exec rake developer_permissions
```

To enable them for your GOV.UK account add them to your account in
[signon](https://github.com/alphagov/signon).

### Importing Whitehall news documents

To populate your local database with [Whitehall][whitehall-repo] content there
is a task in Whitehall to export data and a task in Content Publisher to
import that output.

To export from Whitehall, you need to have a cloned copy of Whitehall with a
populated database, cd into the whitehall directory and run:

```
bundle exec rake export:news_documents 2>&1 | grep created_at > /tmp/whitehall-export.json
```

This will take a while to run (~30 mins), this can be reduced by limiting the
output with [filters][export-filters]

To import this exported file into Content Publisher, you need to cd into the
content publisher directory and run:

```
bundle exec rake import:whitehall_news INPUT=/tmp/whitehall-export.json
```
