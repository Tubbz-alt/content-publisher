    Content Publisher relies on background jobs to load data from other GOV.UK
    applications. To resolve this error ensure that the worker process is
    running for Content Publisher.

    Alternatively or if you are experiencing issues with the worker, you can
    run the job directly in a rails console which should tell you more:
    `PopulateBulkDataJob.perform_now`.
