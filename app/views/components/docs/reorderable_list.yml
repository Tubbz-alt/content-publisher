name: Reorderable list
description: A list of items that can be reordered
body: |
  List items can be reordered by drag and drop or by using the up/down buttons.
  On small viewports the drag and drop feature is disabled to prevent being triggered
  when scrolling on touch devices.

  This component uses SortableJS - a JavaScript library for drag and drop interactions.
  When JavaScript is disabled a set of inputs will be shown allowing users to provide
  an order index for each item.
accessibility_criteria: |
  Buttons in this component must:

  * be keyboard focusable
  * inform the user about which item they operate on
  * preserve focus after interacting with them
